Card Game Simulation

-- Simulation --
PackGenerator can be used to generate a valid pack, but it was made for testing purposes only.
CardGame runs the simulation.

-- Testing --
The test is contained within the TestRunner class.
Almost every test is completed using asserts, however some tests (those involving CardHolder.outputLine())
output their result to a file.
This output is located at Testing/JUnit.
